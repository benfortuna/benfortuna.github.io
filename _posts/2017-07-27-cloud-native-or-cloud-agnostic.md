title: Cloud-native or Cloud-agnostic?

Cloud-native, in it's simplest definition, means application software designed
for deployment to Cloud infrastructure. As more organisations are going "all-in" on
the promise of the Cloud, they are committing their application designs to an assumption
of cloud infrastructure. Such assumptions can help reduce complexity and encourage greater
abstraction of infrastructure resources, leading to more maintainable code. By removing the
constraints of finite infrastructure resources, and the assumptions implicit with pre-ordained
hardware infrastructure, developers are free to conceptualise designs that are more scalable
and modular in design.

The biggest challenge to the rise of such new-age "free thinkers" is cost. Organisations are
quickly discovering that all those little pieces of the infrastructure puzzle quickly add up
to a large, expensive cash pit. There are many different approaches to cost-optimisation, but
two which stand out as an up-front design commitment are Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and
Serverless architectures.

The promise of PaaS is that Cloud companies can leverage their experience and insight into running
large scalable infrastructure to provide a platform that will meet the needs of the majority of
software architectures whilst reducing the overhead of managing complex designs.
