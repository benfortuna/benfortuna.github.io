It is well-known that DevOps was founded on the desire for greater collaboration between
software developers and operations teams. A lesser-acknowledged third pillar of DevOps is
Quality Assurance (QA).

Traditionally the focus of QA teams has been to provide score cards based on functional and
non-functional testing of software releases. If the software didn't meet specifications it
would be returned to developers for further improvements. This waterfall approach to testing
often evades the Agile treatment of software due to the distance between teams, both in
location and mindset.

With the rapid spread of build pipeline and infrastructure-as-code, Quality Assurance is more
important than ever.
